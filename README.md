# Player-Rating-Stats-Model
A player stats analysis model to simplify and understand complicated datasets. Still currently a work-in-progress but is in a respectable state currently.

At this stage this model has no ability to factor the difficulty of competition that these players have faced. There is also no weighting factor for quality of teammates yet.
